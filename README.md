# @barfinex/config

**`@barfinex/config`** is the **centralized configuration and environment management layer** of the [Barfinex](https://barfinex.com) ecosystem — an open-source platform for algorithmic trading, quantitative research, and digital asset infrastructure.

This package provides a unified way to **define, load, and validate configuration options** across all Barfinex services and libraries. It ensures that every microservice (detectors, advisors, connectors, etc.) works with a consistent and validated configuration source.

---

It helps to:
- provide **consistent environment variables and configuration models**;
- reduce duplication of config handling logic across services;
- improve reliability by validating required settings before service startup.
